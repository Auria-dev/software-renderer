Software renderer

Its written in C99 and aims to have a modular architecture, like a simplified OpenGL running on the CPU.




why this?
i wanted to start learning how to use graphics APIs but i did not feel like watching hours of video tutorials just to [...]. So i thought "what if i rewrite my software renderer to have cleaner code, and to be somewhat similar to OpenGL?"  
So i did that.
